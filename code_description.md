### Code Overview

This Python code is designed to **fetch METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report), TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast), and GAMET (general meteorological forecast) reports** from the Turkish State Meteorological Service (MGM) Rasat website and send them to a Telegram channel. The application performs the following operations:

1. **Fetches browser headers from an API** to simulate a legitimate browser request to MGM Rasat.
2. **Parses METAR, TAF, and GAMET reports** from the fetched JSON data.
3. **Sends the parsed reports to a Telegram channel** using the Telegram API.
4. **Runs every 30 minutes to check for new weather reports**.

### Code Sections

#### 1. `__init__` Method (Class Constructor)

This method initializes the class and sets up some basic configurations:

```python
def __init__(self):
```

- **`self.base_url` and `self.url_obs_types`**: These define the base URL for making requests to the Rasat website. It fetches weather data for specified airfields.

- **`self._api_key` and `self._api_url`**: These are used to fetch browser headers from `scrapeops.io`, which simulates a real browser request to avoid getting blocked.

- **`self.telegram_bot`**: This defines the base URL for sending messages to a specific Telegram channel using the Telegram API. The `chat_id` represents the Telegram channel, and the bot key allows access to the bot.

- **`self.last_metar_report`**: Stores the last METAR report to prevent duplicate messages from being sent repeatedly.

- **`self.local_time`**: This sets the timezone to **Istanbul** using `pytz`.

- **`self.accept`**: A flag used to control the sending of reports. If new data is available, it allows sending; otherwise, it prevents resending old data.

#### 2. `get_browser_headers()` Method

This function fetches random browser headers from an API (`scrapeops.io`) to make requests to the Rasat website:

```python
def get_browser_headers(self):
```

- **`requests.get(self._api_url)`**: Sends a GET request to the API URL with the API key, requesting a random browser header to avoid being blocked when making the request to the weather site.

- **Exception Handling**: If the request fails, it returns a message indicating that the script could not generate a browser header.

#### 3. `prepare_the_data()` Method

This method prepares the data for the API request by formatting the stations into the required URL format:

```python
def prepare_the_data(self, *args) -> str:
```

- **`*args`**: Accepts a list of station codes (e.g., LTAB for Esenboğa Airport) to be used in the weather data request.
- **`self.size_of_param`**: Stores the number of stations to be queried.
- **`self.searched_airfields`**: Stores the list of airfields passed as arguments.
- **Returns**: The function returns a complete URL to request data from the Rasat website for the specified stations.

#### 4. `decoder()` Method

This static method decodes the JSON response received from the Rasat website, extracting the METAR and TAF reports:

```python
@staticmethod
def decoder(json_file, metar_size):
```

- **`json_file`**: The JSON file containing the weather data.
- **`metar_size`**: The number of airfields (stations) requested.
- **`metars`**: A list that stores the decoded weather reports for each station.
- **Returns**: A list of METAR reports for each requested airfield.

#### 5. `get_json_file()` Method

This method generates the browser headers and sends the request to the Rasat website:

```python
def get_json_file(self, request_url: str):
```

- **`header = self.get_browser_headers()`**: Fetches the headers from the API using the previously defined `get_browser_headers()` method.
- **`requests.get(request_url, headers=header)`**: Sends a GET request to the Rasat website using the generated headers.
- **If Successful**: If the request is successful (`status_code == 200`), the method parses the response using the `decoder()` method and returns the data in JSON format.
- **Error Handling**: If there's an issue (e.g., the Rasat website is down), an error message is returned.

#### 6. `run_up_program()` Method

This is the main method that runs continuously, checking the time and fetching data every 30 minutes:

```python
def run_up_program(self):
```

- **`valid_time`**: Fetches the current time using the previously defined Istanbul timezone.
- **Time Check**: The program checks the time and runs at minutes 2 and 31 of each hour, making the API request for the airfield weather data.
- **`self.prepare_the_data("LTAB")`**: Prepares the URL to fetch weather data for Esenboğa Airport (LTAB).
- **`results_for_report`**: The JSON response from the Rasat website.
- **Parsing**: The method loops through the returned data, checking for METAR, TAF, or GAMET reports.
- **Telegram Message**: If a new METAR report is found (not the same as the last one), it is formatted and sent to the Telegram channel using the API.

#### Infinite Loop

```python
while True:
    c.run_up_program()
```

- The program runs in an infinite loop, constantly checking for new weather reports and sending them to the Telegram channel at specified intervals.
